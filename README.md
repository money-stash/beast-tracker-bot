I'm looking to hire a skilled Telegram bot developer to build a custom accountability bot for my elite men's fitness and personal development group called The UNSTOPPABLE Lifestyle.
The bot will be called "Beast Tracker" and should run within a private Telegram group. The purpose of this bot is to help members track their Daily Minimum Exercise (DME), stay accountable to their partners, compete on leaderboards, and receive motivation and nudges.
This bot is NOT for public use.

Core Features (Phase 1):
• ✅ Daily Check-In Prompt with buttons (Yes/No)
• 🔥 Streak Tracking with automated milestones/shoutouts
• 📊 Weekly Leaderboards (Top Streaks, Comebacks, etc.)
• 🤝 Accountability Partner System (auto-pair & notify if no check-in)
• 🏆 Wall of Fame for members with 100% DME in a month
• ⚔️ Mini Challenges (e.g. 7-day pushup streaks — opt-in & tracked)
• 📲 Optional Daily Motivation Message (Text or audio from me)
• 🛠️ Admin Panel or Dashboard (View logs, export data, assign partners)

Technical Notes:
• Bot should support ~50 users initially
• Prefer storing data in Google Sheets or a simple database (SQLite/MySQL)
• Easy deployment and management by a non-developer
• Bonus if you're able to help host or deploy on something like Heroku, Railway, or AWS

Deliverables:
• Fully functional bot deployed and running in our private Tg group
• Setup instructions for me to manage/reuse in future groups
• Simple UI or back-end to monitor check-ins and progress
• Optional: Image-based shoutouts or exports I can use for social media
